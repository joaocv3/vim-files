# A practical Vim configuration

## Configuration

### Setup basic configs

  To set up the config, do the following (on your home directory):

  ```terminal
  ln -s 'path_to_where_you_cloned_the_repo' .vim/
  ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
  ln -s .vim/gvimrc .gvimrc (for gui configuration)
  ```

### Setup Vundle

  We are now using Vundle to manage the plugins \o/.

  The first time you clone this repo you will also need to clone the vundle plugin (from you home folder):

  ```terminal
  git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git .vim/bundle/vundle
  ```

  Then you need to tell vundle to install the plugins:
  ```terminal
  vim +PluginInstall +qall
  ```
  or from inside Vim:

  ```vim
  :PluginInstall
  ```

### Extras
#### THE OLD FONT IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE, PLEASE UPDATE
  If you want to use the fancy status bar on the Mac (it is on by default on the Mac) you will also need to install the 'Sauce Code Powerline Light' font on the extra/fonts folder.
  It can be deactivated on the conf/defaults file.

## Shortcuts (fairly outdated list, I will update them soon)

  The majority of shortcuts are made to use with Rails development. So far this is done by default, but the intent of this config if to be flexible and so there will be a way to define which shortcuts to create depending on what is being used.

  * AutoComplete

    `<Control-Shift-Space>       ` - opens the autocomplete menu

  * NerdTree

    `<F2>                        ` - open the NERDTree windows (drawer)

  * Search/Open **OUDATED**

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-f>        ` - search for a file (it is possible to filter the search)

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-o>        ` - show the open files (buffers). The last viewed file is selected and you can also filter the result

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-t> c      ` - search for a tag in the current buffer

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-t> a      ` - search for a tag in all open buffers

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-t> w      ` - search for the word under the cursor as a tag in current buffer

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-t> W      ` - search for the word under the cursor as a tag in all open buffers

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-t> s      ` - search for the selection as a tag in current buffer

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-t> S      ` - search for the selection as a tag in all open buffers

  * Rails specific (you can press tab to auto-complete in most of them) **OUTDATED**

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-m>        ` - opens a model

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-c>        ` - opens a controller

    `<Alt/Option-Shift-v>        ` - opens a view
